# Pigment Reliability Audit - Thresholds Configuration
# Adjust these values based on your workspace characteristics

# Performance thresholds (in milliseconds)
performance:
  metric_execution:
    watch: 3000      # > 3s: worth monitoring
    warning: 5000    # > 5s: needs attention
    critical: 30000  # > 30s: critical issue

  view_render:
    watch: 2000      # > 2s: worth monitoring
    warning: 3000    # > 3s: needs attention
    critical: 15000  # > 15s: critical issue

# Computed rows thresholds
computed_rows:
  watch: 500000      # > 500K rows
  warning: 1000000   # > 1M rows
  critical: 10000000 # > 10M rows

# Dimensional complexity thresholds
dimensions:
  watch: 5           # > 5 dimensions
  warning: 6         # > 6 dimensions
  critical: 10       # > 10 dimensions

# Scoping optimization targets
scoping:
  fully_scoped_target: 50    # % of metrics that should be FullyScoped
  non_scoped_warning: 30     # % non-scoped triggers warning
  non_scoped_critical: 50    # % non-scoped triggers critical

# Scoring weights (must sum to 100)
scoring:
  performance_weight: 25
  optimization_weight: 25
  complexity_weight: 25
  views_weight: 25

# Grade thresholds
grades:
  A: 90
  B: 75
  C: 60
  D: 40
  # Below D threshold = F
